  <h1 class="article-title">Why Am I Doing This?</h1>
  <div class="article-content"><p>Hey look at this - I&#8217;ve restructed my site once again! A little history - I&#8217;ve always wanted to start a blog, but kept running into different obstacles that kept me from starting it.</p>

<p>One obstacle that I had was getting ownership of &#8216;dannybeard.com&#8217;. I know what you&#8217;re saying&#8230; why didn&#8217;t I just use a different url? Well, you&#8217;re right - but I get stuck on things like this sometimes&#8230; In any case, the domain has passed several different Danny Beard&#8217;s through out the years, and every time I tried contacting the owner about purchasing it - no response. Along the way, I did manage to snag a pretty sweet subdomain however: &#8216;danny.beard.com&#8217;. I think it&#8217;s cool at least&#8230; I contacted the owner, and he was nice enough to help out a distant &#8216;relative&#8217;. In fact, danny.beard.com still resolves to this site, so either domain can be used interchangeably. Finally, I tried once again to contact the owner of dannybeard.com, and we were able to work out the details for my purchase of the domain!</p>

<p>So, having that done, I originally put a portfolio site up for myself. I was just now finishing school and looking for a job, so it was the logical thing to do. Of course, the site had some downfalls: namely it was done in Flash (which caused several issues looking back), and there was no easy way to add new content and projects.</p>

<p>So, with the new version of dannybeard.com, I hope to first of all be able to share some of the projects and work that I&#8217;ve done, but also share any tips and hints that I&#8217;ve learned along the way. I do this for myself as well, because I tend to forget how I did certain things unless I write it down. If you do happen to find this site for some odd reason, feel free to comment and discuss - I would very much appreciate knowing that something I&#8217;ve written has helped someone else along the way. I certainly know that other people&#8217;s blogs have helped me.</p>

<p>Now, I just need to write&#8230;.</p>
